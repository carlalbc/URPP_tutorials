### UZH Bioinformatic Courses 2018 ~ URPP "_Evolution in action_"


Welcome to URPP tutorials! :octocat:

Here you will find the **UZH URPP Bioinformatics Program for the year 2018**.

We already had a fantastic course of **tidyverse/dplyr** by Stefan Wyder at the beginning of June, please check his [github page](https://github.com/swyder/dplyr_tutorial) for more information. 

***Next courses:**

- **Productivity tools**: July 2018 

A dynamic course where we will all share our day-to-day productivity tools. From a classic notebook to a mobile app, going through command-line tricks and programming work-arounds.

We will show you how to improve your efficiency using _bioawk_, _GNU datamash_ and other useful tricks that will help you become faster and type much less in the terminal.

-**Section I**: [Bioawk](https://github.com/swyder/): Modification of awk to work with many bioinformatic format files such as BED, SAM, etc.

- **Section II**: [GNU Datamash](https://github.com/carlalbc/URPP_tutorials/blob/master/Productivity_tools_GNUdatamash.md): Command-line program to perform with basic stats calculations using text files as input.


- **_To be determined_**. We are always open to suggestions!
