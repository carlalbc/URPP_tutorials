### UZH Bioinformatic Courses 2018 ~ URPP "_Evolution in action_"


Welcome to URPP tutorials! :octocat:

Here you will find the **UZH URPP Bioinformatics Program for the year 2018**.

We already had a fantastic course of **tidyverse/dplyr** by Stefan Wyder at the beginning of June, please check https://github.com/swyder/dplyr_tutorial for more information. 

*Next:*

- **Productivity tools**: July 2018

A dynamic course where we will all share our day-to-day productivity tools. From a classic notebook to a mobile app.

We will show you how to improve your efficiency in the command line using _bioawk_, _datamash_ and other useful tricks that will help you become faster and type much less.


- **_To be determined_**. We are always open to suggestions!
