### UZH Bioinformatic Courses 2018 ~ URPP "_Evolution in action_"


Welcome to URPP tutorials! :octocat:

Here you will find the **UZH URPP Bioinformatics Program for the year 2018**.

We already had a fantastic course of **tidyverse/dplyr** by Stefan Wyder at the beginning of June, please check his [Github page](https://github.com/swyder/dplyr_tutorial) for more information. 

*Next courses:*

### I) **Productivity tools**: July 2018 

A dynamic course where we will all share our day-to-day productivity tools. From a classic notebook to a mobile app, going through command-line tricks and programming work-arounds.

We will show you how to improve your efficiency using _bioawk_, _GNU datamash_ and other useful tricks that will help you become faster and type much less in the terminal.

- **Section I**: [Bioawk](https://github.com/swyder/): Modification of awk to work with many bioinformatic format files such as BED, SAM, etc.

- **Section II**: [GNU Datamash](https://github.com/carlalbc/URPP_tutorials/tree/master/Productivity_tools_2018): Command-line program to perform table modifications, calculations and basic stats using text files as an input.


### II) **Genome visualization**. October 2018 
- **Section I**: [Genome Browsers](): A tour on several key genome browsers and customization track tips.
- **Section II**: [Visualization with R](https://github.com/swyder) - Heatmaps and karyoplots.

### III) **To be determined**. November 2018
